    <p>Mara Flora is a clothing brand based in
      Lisbon, created by its eponymous designer.
      Mara graduated from Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade de Lisboa in 2014.  On March 2018 she was one of the winners of Bloom Portugal Fashion competition for young designers.</p>
    <p>Mara Flora takes inspiration from real life and contemporary culture. Pursuing an experimental, sustainable and, somehow, subversive attitude towards fashion, the intent is to convey new narratives through a wardrobe that combines avant-garde, workwear and streetwear.
